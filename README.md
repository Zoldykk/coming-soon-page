## Challenge
    
<p>Your challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.<p/>

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

     * Receive an error message when the form is submitted if any
     * See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
     * Submit their email address using an input field
     * Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
        * The input field is empty
        * The email address is not formatted correctly
